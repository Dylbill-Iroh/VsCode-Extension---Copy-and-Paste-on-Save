# copy-and-paste-on-save README
- A simple extension to copy and paste current file to one or more locations when saving.

## How to use
- After installing, look for the command "Copy Paste On Save - Set folder(s) for current file."
- Here you can set additional folder(s) the current file is saved to.
- These should be the full folder path(s). If setting more than one, they should be seperated by a semicolon ;
- e.g "C:\SomeFolder;C:\SomeOtherFolder"
- After folders are set, you can use the command "Copy Paste On Save - Copy Folder(s) From Current File" then in a different file use the command: "Copy Paste On Save - Paste Folder(s) To Current File" to set the same folders for that file.

## Search order
- When saving a file, search order for finding folders to copy the file to are as follows:
- Full file path in workspace state.
- Base file name in workspace state.
- Full file path in global state.
- Base file name in global state.
